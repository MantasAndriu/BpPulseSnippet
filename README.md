Hello, WoolSocks!
First of all, thank you for allowing me to participate and take this challenge. It was a great homework task and I hope you will like my solution, due to limited time I have add just few tests and didnâ€™t spend so much on design, I hope this 6 hours spend will show at-least a bit my skills. So, this project was bootstrapped with Create React App. I chose this for a faster start because this is a demo/prototype, for real product I would build project without "create react app" to keep it lighter.
Most time I have spent on setting up everything and ran in some issues with typescript saga and later on with jest version. But after some time, app started to work as expected from my side.
